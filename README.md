🔧 40 MHz RTL Design Project

This repository contains the complete RTL design, constraints, and verification environment for a 40 MHz digital system implemented in Verilog. The project demonstrates a clean, synthesizable, and timing-aware hardware design flow using industry-standard practices.

📌 Key Features

✔️ Fully synthesizable Verilog RTL

✔️ Designed and optimized to run at 40 MHz

✔️ Clean modular architecture for easy understanding

✔️ Includes testbenches for functional verification

✔️ Constraints and configuration files for synthesis & implementation

✔️ Compatible with common open-source and commercial EDA tools

🗂️ Repository Structure

/src/ – RTL modules

/tb/ – Testbench files

/constraints/ – Timing & design constraints
